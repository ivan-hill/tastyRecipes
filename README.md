# Recipes App


## 💻 Project

 In this app it is possible to view, search, filter, favorite and track the progress of preparation of recipes and drinks! The database has 2 distinct APIs, one for food ([TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/)) and another for drinks ([The CockTailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)). Unit tests were implemented with Jest and the organization of the activities was done following the Kanban model, using the tool [Trello](https://trello.com/). Go to [PROJECT]() for more details.
